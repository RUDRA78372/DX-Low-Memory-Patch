# DX-Low-Memory-Patch

Straightup I don't remember why I made this back in 2019. This is a replacement dll for d3dx9 that makes the game (or any other program that uses the dll) think that the system has 2GB RAM. Just place the dll near the game executable and see what happens, if anything happens at all.


You will need DelphiDetours library to compile it.
